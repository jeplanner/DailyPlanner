"""
Background scheduler that sends Web Push reminders for checklist items
whose reminder times match the user's local "now".

Design:
  * Runs every minute (APScheduler BackgroundScheduler).
  * For each user that has at least one active push subscription, we
    resolve their IANA timezone (cached in-process) and compute the
    local HH:MM and weekday.
  * For every checklist_reminder_times row whose time matches the local
    HH:MM and whose parent's schedule applies to today, we attempt to
    insert a row into checklist_reminder_log keyed on (item_id,
    sent_date, reminder_time) so each fire is independently deduped.
  * The unique constraint makes this safe across multiple gunicorn
    workers — only the first insert wins, and only that worker calls
    push_service.send_to_user().
  * Items with no child reminder_times rows fall back to the legacy
    checklist_items.reminder_time column for backwards compat.

The scheduler starts once inside create_app(); a module-level flag
prevents duplicate starts when the factory is invoked multiple times
(tests, reloads).
