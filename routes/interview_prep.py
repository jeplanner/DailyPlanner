"""Interview Prep Coach — a motivating, on-track interview tracker.

Built for a senior run (Senior Director / Head of Technical Program
Management): a readiness score, a curated syllabus with confidence
levels, a STAR story bank, a daily practice log driving a streak, and a
coach that celebrates when you're ahead and *scolds* when you skip a day
or fall behind pace.

Readiness and streak are computed on the fly from topics / stories /
sessions — nothing to keep in sync. Schema: MIGRATION_INTERVIEW_PREP.sql.
Soft-delete only (deleted_at).

# AI SDE → CALENDAR — drop a topic onto a specific day
#
# The ask was a study plan you can *see*: pick a topic on /ai-sde, pick a
# day, and have it show up in the three places that already exist rather
# than in a fourth one invented for it —
#
#   * the AISDEPrep project, so the whole syllabus has one home;
#   * the calendar grid for that day;
#   * the Quick Bucket, so it is in front of her without opening the
#     calendar at all.
#
# WHY MIDNIGHT WHEN NO TIME IS GIVEN. planner_v2.js builds the grid with
# `for (let hour = 0; hour < 24; hour++)`, so hour 0 is the first row on
# the page. A 00:00 start therefore pins the topic to the very top of the
# day the way an all-day row does in Google Calendar — visible the moment
# the day opens, and out of the way of anything actually timed. It is a
# deliberate position, not a null standing in for one.
#
# WHY THIS DOES NOT POST TO /api/v2/events. That endpoint runs
# get_conflicts() and returns 409 unless the caller forces it. Stacking
# five topics at 00:00 on the same morning is the *intended* use here, so
# every one after the first would be rejected for overlapping the last.
# This writes the daily_events row directly, which is the same table the
# calendar reads.
#
# Three inserts, no transaction. If a later one fails the earlier ones
# survive, which is the right way round: the project task is the record
# of what she planned to study, and the other two are views onto it.
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

#: The banks that can be scheduled onto a day, and the project each one
#: lands in. Looked up by name — there is no project id stored anywhere,
#: because the name IS the handle.
#:
#: Each bank names the list its entries come from, the FIELD that holds
#: the topic's text (the behavioural bank calls it `q`, the other two
#: `title`), and the prefix its ids carry. Keeping the three differences
#: in a table beats three near-identical endpoints: the scheduling itself
#: — get-or-create the project, write the task, the event, the bucket row,
#: mirror to Google — is the same work whichever bank asked for it.

    — but the fix was already in place one layer down: supabase_client hands

    and is decoded back into the value. The quotes were then matched
    LITERALLY, against values that contain no quotes.

    WHY THIS EXISTS. Ticking a topic as studied used to update only the
    STUDY record (ai_sde_progress on /ai-sde, localStorage on /java and
    /sql). But scheduling a topic writes THREE other rows — a project task,
    a calendar event and a Quick Bucket line — and none of them heard about
    it. So the Day Board went on showing the topic as outstanding and the
    bucket went on listing it, after it had been done. The tick was true in
    one place and false in three.

    REVERSIBLE, because un-ticking has to work too. `done: false` puts all
    three back to open rather than leaving a topic permanently closed after
    a mis-click.

    SILENT WHEN NOTHING WAS SCHEDULED. Most topics are never put on a day,
    and ticking one of those is not an error — it just has nothing else to

    THE TENSION THIS RESOLVES. The body is set large (26pt) so it can be
    read on a phone. But the bank's worked examples are pre-wrapped ASCII
    drawn to a MEASURED median of 101 columns (p99 = 107) — code to 76,
    diagrams to 68. A 105-column block cannot be shown at 26pt on any page
    that also gives prose a sane measure; that is arithmetic, not a bug.

    The old renderer fed those blocks through multi_cell at a fixed 8pt on
    a 182 mm column, so every line that overflowed HARD-WRAPPED and the art
    became noise. Here each monospace block is measured and scaled so its
    widest line fits the column exactly — small, but intact and zoomable.
    Blocks that would fall under _PDF_MONO_FLOOR_PT get their own landscape
    page instead, where they land ~47% larger.

    NOT DONE, and not doable here: true reflow ("Adobe liquid mode") needs
    a tagged PDF with a structure tree over the paragraphs. fpdf2 2.8.x
    builds a structure tree for outlines and links only and exposes no
    public API to tag body text, so this sets the document language and
    title — which is what helps a reader — and stops short of claiming
    reflow it does not provide.
