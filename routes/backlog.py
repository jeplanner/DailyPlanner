"""The capture inbox: one place to dump every task, and the router out.

WHAT THIS IS FOR
----------------
"it should be one source stop for capturing all the laundry list of my
tasks and then i should be able to send it to various things like quick
bucket, projects, inbox, references etc."

So Backlog is where a thought lands when there is no time to decide where
it belongs, and the Quick Bucket is the shorter list of things actually
prioritised to be done. Capture here, route out from here.

WHY THE PROJECT TASKS ARE STILL NOT RELOCATED
---------------------------------------------
This page used to be read-only, for a reason that still holds for one of
the two lists: `project_tasks` carries 40 columns to `quick_bucket`'s 21,
and physically moving a row drops its project, key result, initiative,
epic, sprint, priority and ordering. Project progress is computed from
live task counts, so relocating tasks would silently change the completion
figure on every project they came from.

The routes below therefore write in two different ways on purpose:

  * A CAPTURED item is a quick_bucket row, and routing it really does move
    it — it is created here and has nothing to lose.
  * A PROJECT task is never moved. Promoting one writes a bucket row that
    POINTS at it (quick_bucket.source_task_id) and dates the task for
    today. Both stay in place, the project's figures stay honest, and
    ticking the bucket item closes the task with it. A plain copy was the
    obvious alternative and it lies: two rows for one piece of work makes
    the planner report more outstanding than exists.

Inbox and References are NOT written from here. Both are URL pipelines with
metadata fetching, AI description and auto-categorising behind them; the
browser posts to their own endpoints and then calls /api/backlog/drop, so
there is one implementation of each rather than a poorer second one.

WHAT COUNTS AS BACKLOG
----------------------
Two different shapes of "no date on it yet":

  * Quick Bucket items in the FUTURE bucket — deliberately deferred, no
    deadline, no alarm.
  * Project tasks with no plan_date and no start_time — real work inside a
    project that has never been put on a day.

THE FUTURE RULE IS COPIED FROM THE PAGE, NOT REINVENTED. quick_bucket.js
groups an "at" item into Future when its pinned time falls beyond today, so
this does the same. A backlog that disagreed with the bucket page about what
is in Future would be worse than not having one — that lesson cost this
codebase three separate copies of the checklist schedule rule, each with a
different answer.

    A deadline you have to notice yourself is a deadline you will miss —
    that is the whole reason the backlog needed dates. This is the half
    that makes them worth capturing: the day before something is due, it
    stops being backlog and joins the list you actually work from.

    LAZY, NOT SCHEDULED. It runs when either page is opened rather than on
    a timer, because a background job that quietly stops is exactly the
    failure this app keeps hitting — and there is no point promoting an
    item into a list nobody is looking at. Opening either page is also the
